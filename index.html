                <p>Oranges are a widely cultivated citrus fruit known for their high vitamin C content and vibrant flavor. They belong to the Rutaceae family and the Citrus genus.</p>
                <p>The primary commercial species include Citrus sinensis (sweet orange) and Citrus aurantium (bitter orange). Here’s a breakdown of their technical aspects, including botanical characteristics, nutritional composition, cultivation requirements, and industrial uses:</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Fruit Morphology:</span></p>
                <p>The fruit is technically a berry with a leathery outer rind called a pericarp, which consists of an outer, colored layer (flavedo) and an inner white layer (albedo).</p>
                <p>The inner sections of the fruit are called segments, which contain juice vesicles where the juice is stored.</p>
                <p>The flavor and aroma are derived from essential oils found in the flavedo and juice sacs.</p>

                <p>Oranges are rich in several nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. Here’s a breakdown per 100g of raw orange:</p>

                <header>Cultivation Requirements</header>
                <p>Oranges thrive in subtropical to tropical climates. Here are the main requirements for optimal growth:</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Temperature:</span> Ideal temperatures are between 15°C and 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Extreme cold (< -2°C) can damage or kill orange trees.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Soil:</span> Well-drained, sandy loam soil with pH between 6.0 to 7.5 is ideal. Soil should have adequate organic matter and minerals, especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Watering:</span> Requires a balanced watering schedule. Over-irrigation leads to root rot, while under-irrigation affects fruit development. Drip irrigation is commonly used to manage water efficiently.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Sunlight:</span> Requires full sunlight for at least 6 hours daily to maximize photosynthesis and fruit development.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Propagation:</span> Typically propagated through grafting onto rootstocks that offer disease resistance and enhance tolerance to environmental stresses.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Harvesting_and_Post-Harvest_Handling">
                <header>Harvesting and Post-Harvest Handling</header>
                <p><span class="bold">Harvesting:</span> Oranges are usually handpicked to avoid bruising. Mechanical harvesting is less common as it can damage the fruits and trees.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Ripening:</span> Oranges don’t ripen post-harvest, so they must be picked when fully ripe. Ethylene gas treatment is sometimes used to enhance color, especially for markets that prefer deep orange hues.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Storage:</span> Oranges are stored between 5°C to 10°C in controlled humidity (85-90%) environments to extend shelf life and prevent mold growth.</p>

                <header>Industrial Uses and By-products</header>
                <code><span class="bold">Juice Production:</span> Orange juice is one of the most popular fruit juices globally, requiring the extraction of juice from fresh fruit and, sometimes, pasteurization to extend shelf life.</code>
                <code><span class="bold">Essential Oils:</span> The flavedo or peel is rich in essential oils, especially d-limonene, which is extracted for use in food flavoring, cosmetics, and household products.</code>
                <code><span class="bold">Pectin:</span> The albedo (white layer) is rich in pectin, a polysaccharide used as a gelling agent in jams and jellies.</code>
                <code><span class="bold">Biofuel and Industrial Alcohol:</span> The residual pulp and peel are sometimes processed into biofuel and industrial alcohols due to their high carbohydrate content.</code>
                <code><span class="bold">Animal Feed:</span> The by-products (peels, pulp, and seeds) from juice production are often dried and used as cattle feed.</code>
